Lessons learned:

Use random variables only during epoch generation and then hand over
the next batches batch by batch.
Dropout is great on overkill nets
TFRecords are definetly faster than whatever this is doing
Prepare Data using numpy, not tensors
Model as classes are cleaner
Good interface for data utility:
1) Describe data source
2) Generate epochs
3) call get_next_batch()
Operations with random array manipulation are CPU intensive
feed_dict's are cool, let's try out pipes instead :D
